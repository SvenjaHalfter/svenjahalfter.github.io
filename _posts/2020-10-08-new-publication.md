My new [publication](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.567917/full) on how zooplankton help establishing carbon export regimes in the Southern Ocean is finally out! Together with my amazing co-authors and mentors Emma Cavan, Ruth Eriksen, Kerrie Swadling and Philip Boyd, I wrote a mini-review as part of the [IMBeR Special Issue](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/11599/integrated-marine-biosphere-research-ocean-sustainability-under-global-change-for-the-benefit-of-soc#articles). 

We compared two sites: the northern Kerguelen Plateau, which is a naturally iron-fertilised region and characterised by high surface productivity but low carbon export, and the HNLC waters south of Australia, which are less productive and iron-limited but exhibit high carbon export. Zooplankton grazing plays an important role in establishing these contrasting export regimes. Check out the infographic below!
