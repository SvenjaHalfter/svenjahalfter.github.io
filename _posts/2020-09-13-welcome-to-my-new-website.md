This is my new website, which I set up with [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and which is inspired by the websites of my amazing supervisor and mentor [Emma Cavan](https://e-cavan.github.io/) and friend [Kimberlee Baldry](https://kimbaldry.github.io/FriendlyExperts/). Make sure you check out their work as well.

Here you will find all about my work, future fieldwork, recent publications and newest scicomm adventures!

Enjoy! :relaxed:
