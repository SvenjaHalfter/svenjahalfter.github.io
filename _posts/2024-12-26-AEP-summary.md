Ever wondered on if there are any invasive species in the Southern Ocean? Me and my amazing co-author team wrote a short summary upon request of the editor of the [Antarctic Environments Portal](https://environments.aq/). The aim of the portal is to link Antarctic science with policy, i.e., make science accessible for policymakers and managers in the Southern Ocean.
