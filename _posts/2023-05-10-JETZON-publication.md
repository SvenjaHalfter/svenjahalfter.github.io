Together with a team of early-career exports from the JETZON ECR group, I recently published a comment in Communications Earth and Environment! 
We argue that before we exploit the deep sea and especially the ocean twilight zone (i.e. mesopelagic zone), we need to learn more about the ecosystem and the services it provides. 

Read the paper [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00823-4) or check out my summary on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/svenja_halfter/status/1655323556367179776). 

Thanks to my amazing co-authors to make this possible and especially Kelsey Bisson in leading this effort. I'm looking forward to work with you in future!
