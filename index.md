# Welcome!

Read all about my current research projects, recent publications, and upcoming fieldwork campaigns. 

# About me

I'm a zooplankton ecologist and biogeochemist with a PhD from the [University of Tasmania](https://www.utas.edu.au/) in Australia and currently work for [Earth Sciences New Zealand](https://niwa.co.nz/) Wellington. I have extensive experience in ship- and ice-based fieldwork and am passionate about communicating my research to a broad audience.

My main research interests are:
•	Zooplankton physiology and ecology
•	Ecosystem responses to climate change, both pelagic and sympagic
•	Marine carbon cycling and sequestration, and mCDR technologies
•	Long-term time series, in particular of biological data 
•	Science needs of Marine Protected Areas
•	Essential Variable development, e.g., EOVs and EBVs
