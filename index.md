# Welcome!

Read further about my current research projects, recent publications, coming up fieldwork and science communication initiatives. 

# About me

I'm a marine scientist with a MSc in Marine Biology from the [University of Rostock](https://www.uni-rostock.de/en/) in Germany and the [University Centre in Svalbard](unis.no) in Norway and a PhD degree from the [University of Tasmania](https://www.utas.edu.au/) in Australia. 
Since July 2022, I work for [NIWA](https://niwa.co.nz/) Wellington in New Zealand as zooplankton ecologist. I have extensive experience in ship- and ice-based fieldwork and am passionate in communicating my research to a broad audience.

My main research interests are:
- Relationship between plankton physiology, distribution, and population dynamics, and the Biological Carbon Pump
- Impact of climate change on polar regions, especially on sea-ice ecosystems, and temperate waters around NZ
- Ocean observations and data management
