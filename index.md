# Welcome!

Read further about my current research projects, recent publications, coming up fieldwork and science communication initiatives. 

# About me

I'm a zooplankton ecologist and biogeochemist with a PhD from the [University of Tasmania](https://www.utas.edu.au/) in Australia and currently work for [NIWA](https://niwa.co.nz/) Wellington in New Zealand as a postdoctoral fellow. I have extensive experience in ship- and ice-based fieldwork and am passionate about communicating my research to a broad audience.

My main research interests are:
- Relationship between plankton physiology, distribution, and population dynamics, and the Biological Carbon Pump
- Impact of climate change on polar regions, especially on sea-ice ecosystems, and temperate waters around Aotearoa/New Zealand
- Ocean observations and data management
