# Welcome!

# About me

After graduating with a Master of Science in Marine Biology at the [University of Rostock](https://www.uni-rostock.de/en/) in Germany and at the [University Centre in Svalbard](unis.no) in Norway, I moved to Australia for my PhD in 2017. In early 2022, I finished the PhD on the impact of zooplankton on the subantarctic Biological Carbon Pump at [IMAS](https://www.imas.utas.edu.au/) and I recently moved to New Zealand to work as a zooplankton ecologist for [NIWA](https://niwa.co.nz/).

My main interests are:
- Impact of plankton physiology, distribution, and population dynamics on ecosystem and carbon export
- Climate change in polar ecosystems
- Ocean data collection and management
