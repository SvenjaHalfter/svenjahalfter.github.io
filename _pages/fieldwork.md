## Completed

**Oct-Nov 2024**: Sea ice camp K892 (39 days), McMurdo Sound, Ross Sea, Tasks: Sampling the platelet and sea ice with SIPL and SIPRE corer, respectively, CTD and water sampling, biological sample processing, assistance with physical measurements. 

**Jan-Mar 2024**: *RV Laura Bassi* (36 days), Ross Ice Shelf, eastern and northwestern Ross Sea, Tasks: Zooplankton collection with nets and the Continuous Plankton Recorder. Assisting with drone flights, water sampling, and acoustic calibrations. More information [here](https://www.antarcticscienceplatform.org.nz/research/biodiversity-voyage). 

**Jan-Feb 2023**: *RV Tangaroa* (TAN2302, 45 days), northwestern coast and continental shelf in the Ross Sea, Tasks: Sample collection with nets, the ship's underway system, and the Continuous Plankton Recorder. More information [here](https://niwa.co.nz/our-science/voyages/2023_Antarctica). 

**Oct-Nov 2022**: Sea ice camp K892 (36 days), McMurdo Sound, Tasks: Sampling of the platelet and sea ice, as well as the water column at two different process sites, biological sample processing, assistance with physical and oceanographic measurements. 

**May 2022**: *RV Investigator* (IN2023_V03, 12 days), Subantarctic Southern Ocean, Tasks: CTD deployments and water filtration for POC/PON and pigments, eDNA sampling, Argo float deployment. More information [here](https://mnf.csiro.au/en/Voyages/IN2022_V03). 

**Dec 2020 - Jan 2021**: *RV Investigator* (IN2020_V08, 42 days), Subantarctic and Polar Frontal Zone south of Australia, SOLACE (Southern Ocean Large Area Carbon Export) voyage, Tasks: Processing micronekton from the RMT, collection of zooplankton with nets, respiration, decomposition and faecal pellet incubations with copepods, salps, and amphipods. More information [here](https://mnf.csiro.au/en/Voyages/IN2020_V08). 

**Mar 2020**: *RV Investigator* (IN2020_T01), CAPSTAN voyage to train students in various oceanographic and biological sampling methods, joining the ship as teacher for plankton sampling, but the voyage was cancelled while we were still in port, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and following lockdown in Australia.

**Jan 2020 - Feb 2020**: *RV Umitaka-maru* (UM-19-08, 28 days), Southern Ocean on a transect from Fremantle, Australia, south to the ice edge and returning to Hobart, Australia. Tasks: Processing micronekton and zooplankton from the ORI, VMPS, and MOHT net, respiration and decomposition incubation trials with Antarctic copepods, and ice sampling.
