I am passionate about science communication, because I believe science should be accessible for everyone regardless of age, gender, nationality or socialeconomic background!

## Teaching
I tutored and lectured in the following university courses: 

University of Tasmania
- KSM201 Marine Resource Management and Conservation (Mar-Jun 2021)
- KSM202 Marine and Antarctic ecosystems: (Jul 2018/2019, Aug 2020)
- KSA715 Southern Ocean zooplankton ecology (May 2019)
- KSM308 Marine ecology (Feb 2019/2020)

Macquarie University
- CAPSTAN Voyage 3 (Mar 2020)

## Science communication
As part of the [National Science Week Australia](https://www.scienceweek.net.au/), I was involved in the [Young Tassie Scientist](http://youngtassiescientists.com/) program in 2018 and 2020. I talked to over 1000 school kids from Kindergarten to Year 12 in schools all over Tasmania (2018 and 2021 in person, 2020 virtually), created videos about my life as marine scientist and did a radio interview for ABC Hobart. Watch my video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=imvr14ruOrw&feature=emb_logo&ab_channel=TassieScienceWeek) and don't forget to check out the other scientists as well!

I also enjoy giving public talks, for example in March 2020 as part of the International Women's Day in the Little Creatures Brewery in Fremantle, WA.
