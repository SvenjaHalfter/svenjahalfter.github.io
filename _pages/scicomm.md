title: "Science communication"

I am passionate about science communication, because I believe science should be accessible for everyone regardless of age, gender, nationality or socialeconomic background!

As part of the [National Science Week Australia](https://www.scienceweek.net.au/), I was involved in the [Young Tassie Scientist](http://youngtassiescientists.com/) program in 2018 and 2020. I talked to over 1000 school kids from Kindergarten to Year 12 in schools all over Tasmania (2018 in person, 2020 virtually), created videos about my life as marine scientist and did a radio interview for ABC Hobart. Watch my video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=imvr14ruOrw&feature=emb_logo&ab_channel=TassieScienceWeek) and don't forget to check out the other scientists as well!

I sign up regularly for the ["Skype a Scientist"](https://www.skypeascientist.com/) program, which matches me with school classes all over the world, including Japan, India and USA.

Additionally, I enjoy giving public talks, for example in March 2020 as part of the International Women's Day in the Little Creatures Brewery in Fremantle, WA.
