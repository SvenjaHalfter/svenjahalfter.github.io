## Science communication

I enjoy talking about my science to a broader audience! For example, I had the chance to give public talks in the past, including a [Seaweek Webinar](https://seaweek.org.nz/news/exploring-marine-protected-areas) in July 2024, a presentation of the highlights of the 2022/23 fieldwork season in the "Fresh off the ice" series for the New Zealand Antarctic Society in March 2023, or a talk at the Little Creatures Brewery in Fremantle in March 2020 on the International Women's Day. 

During my PhD in Australia, I was involved in the [Young Tassie Scientist](http://youngtassiescientists.com/) program. During the [National Science Week Australia](https://www.scienceweek.net.au/) in July-August every year, I presented my science in an engaging way to over 1000 school kids from Kindergarten to Year 12 in schools all over Tasmania (2018 and 2021 in person, 2020 virtually), created videos about my life and work as marine scientist, and did a radio interview for ABC Hobart. Watch my video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=imvr14ruOrw&feature=emb_logo&ab_channel=TassieScienceWeek)! I also participated in events such as IMAS Open Days, the Australian Antarctic Festival, or the [Beaker Street Festival](https://www.beakerstreet.com.au/) as a "roving scientist".
