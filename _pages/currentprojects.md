## Role of zooplankton in the Biological Carbon Pump of the Southern Ocean
This PhD projects explores how zooplankton affect the carbon export and sequestration in the subantarctic Southern Ocean. 

In particular, I work on:
- How zooplankton contributes in shaping the characteristic carbon export regimes in the Southern Ocean, looking at two case studies, the Kerguelen Plateau and the high nutrient low chlorophyll region south of Australia. You can read this literature review [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.567917/full).
- Zooplankton swimmer data at the Southern Ocean Time Series site at 47&deg;S south of Australia. This data is collected with long-term sediment traps from the deep ocean, which enables me to connect carbon flux with deep-sea species composition. Check out the [article](http://digital.ecomagazine.com/publication/frame.php?i=674747&p=64&pn=&ver=html5) I wrote about it in ECOmagazine last year. 
- The impact of zooplankton carcasses on the subantarctic carbon flux at certain times of the year, as carcasses have been traditionally overlooked when calculating the oceanic carbon budget. 
- Finding ways on measuring in-situ respiration of zooplankton to test global estimates and models of plankton respiration. 

## MEASO 
I collaborated internationally to establish up a first [Marine Ecosystem Assessment of the Southern Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Ecosystem_Assessment_for_the_Southern_Ocean#:~:text=The%20Marine%20Ecosystem%20Assessment%20for,and%20Ecosystem%20Dynamics%20(ICED).), which started with the MEASO conference in 2018. 

- I contributed to the amphipod pages of the Southern Ocean Knowledge and Information (SOKI) wiki as an encyclopaedic resource in 2019 to enable the development of the first MEASO.
- Together with other ECRs, I wrote and developed an opinion piece on the benefits and obstacles of ECRs in large projects such as MEASO. Find more information [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.00692/full). 
- I am involved in three other MEASO publications, which are expected to come out as part of the [MEASO Special Issue](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/10606/marine-ecosystem-assessment-for-the-southern-ocean-meeting-the-challenge-for-conserving-earth-ecosys#overview) in Frontiers of Marine Science, for example our [synthesis of the future risks for ecoystem services in the Southern Ocean under climate change](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.615214/full).


## SOOS Indian Sector RWG
I am part of the leadership team of the Regional Working Group for the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean (Southern Ocean Observing System - [SOOS](https://www.soos.aq/)) as [APECS](https://www.apecs.is/) representative. We aim for a coordination and implementation of the ocean observing system in the region and cumulating efforts in field work planning up to data management. Stay tuned for exciting science and workshops that will follow soon! In the meantime, check out our latest [newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/cfff07d7ed95/sois-rwg-newsletter-5264400) and consider [signing up for SOOS](https://airtable.com/shrB23cytbgPosZEZ) to stay up to date.
