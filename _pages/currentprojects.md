## Current projects

**Antarctic Science Platform (since 2022)**
[ASP](https://www.antarcticscienceplatform.org.nz/) supported sea ice and ship-based fieldwork in the past three seasons. Objectives are an improved understanding of the pelagic and sympagic ecosystem in the Ross Sea with a particular focus on changes in the zooplankton community with climate change. 

**Continuous Plankton Recorder project (since 2022)**
During the last voyages on the *RV Tangaroa* and *RV Laura Bassi*, I was responsible for the deployment of the Continuous Plankton Recorder. Together with Dr. Matt Pinkerton, I co-authored the [final report](https://fs.fish.govt.nz/Page.aspx?pk=113&dk=25829) to Fisheries New Zealand for the third phase of the CPR. We are currently awaiting confirmation of further funding to continue the time-series.  

**JETZON (since 2021)**
I'm part of the [Joint Exploration of the Twilight Zone Ocean Network](https://jetzon.org/) Steering Committee and ECR group. Previously, we published a short comment on [five reasons to take the precautionary approach to deep-sea exploitation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00823-4) and [incorporating the deep sea into the Ocean Decade](https://doi.org/10.1002/lob.10662). Currently, I lead a working group to benchmark the migratory flux component in the Biological Carbon Pump, with Dr. Deborah Steinberg (VIMS, USA) as a mentor. 

**SOOS leadership (since 2020)**
Since November 2020, I have been part of the leadership team of the Regional Working Group for the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean ([SOOS](https://www.soos.aq/activities/rwg/sois)). We aim for coordination and implementation of the ocean observing system in the region and cumulating efforts in fieldwork planning up to data management. At the moment, I am working on reviewing the spatial and temporal coverage of ocean observations in the region (to be submitted by the end of December 2024).

## Previous projects
**Ross-RAMP (2022-2023)**
As part of Ross-RAMP, I participated in Antarctic fieldwork in 2022/23 on the metazoan distribution in the sympagic ecoysystem of McMurdo Sund and the variability of zooplankton communities in the northwestern Ross Sea. I also assisted a PhD project to improve the genetic database of Southern Ocean zooplankton. 

**SKEG and ICED Krill research (2021-2024)** 
Following the [ICED](https://www.iced.ac.uk/index.htm) krill workshop in May 2021 (workshop report [here](https://www.iced.ac.uk/products.htm)), I contributed to a publication on working on modelling krill recruitment (in review). Additionally, I co-authored a publication on krill observation methods together with the [SCAR Krill Expert Group](https://www.scar.org/science/skeg/about/) (Link [here](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2024.1307402)).

**SOLACE (2020-2022)**
I joined the [SOLACE](https://solace2020.net/) (Southern Ocean Large Area Carbon Export) voyage December 2020 - January 2021 as zooplankton expert. My research on board focused on quantifying the seasonal lipid pump, the mesopelagic migrant pump, jelly falls, and amphipod-mediated carbon export. I'm currently working on publishing the results. I also supported research on [Deep Chlorophyll Maxima](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GB008033) and contributed to a review on the role of biota in the carbon pump of the Southern Ocean, published in [Nature Reviews](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43017-024-00531-3).

**PhD project: Role of zooplankton in the Biological Carbon Pump of the subantarctic Southern Ocean (2017-2021)**
My PhD project explored how zooplankton impact carbon export and sequestration in the subantarctic Southern Ocean. 

My chapters included:
- How zooplankton contribute to shaping the characteristic carbon export regimes in the Southern Ocean. Read about it [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.567917/full).
- Deep-sea zooplankton data at the Southern Ocean Time Series site at 47&deg;S south of Australia, collected in long-term sediment traps. Check out my [ECOmagazine article](http://digital.ecomagazine.com/publication/frame.php?i=674747&p=64&pn=&ver=html5). 
- The impact of zooplankton carcasses on subantarctic carbon flux, as carcasses have been traditionally overlooked when calculating the oceanic carbon budget. Find the published study [here](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.11971). 
- Finding ways to measure in-situ respiration of zooplankton to test global estimates and models of plankton respiration. More information will be published soon.
- As a bonus, I found a new species, which I named and described [here](https://zse.pensoft.net/article/32548/)! 

**MEASO (2018-2021)**
I contributed to the first [Marine Ecosystem Assessment of the Southern Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Ecosystem_Assessment_for_the_Southern_Ocean#:~:text=The%20Marine%20Ecosystem%20Assessment%20for,and%20Ecosystem%20Dynamics%20(ICED).), which started with the MEASO conference in 2018. I was involved in several publications, including on [zooplankton in the Southern Ocean](https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2021.624692), [ecosystem services](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2020.615214), [data systems](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.637063), and [ECR perspectives](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2020.00692).
