## Current projects
**JETZON (since 2021)**
As part of the [JETZON](https://jetzon.org/) ECR group, I currently work on an article to communicate the importance of the oceans' twilight zone. I am also responsible for organising the JETZON call (Australian time slot) to showcase current mesopelagic research.

**ICED krill modelling (since 2021)** 
Following the [ICED](https://www.iced.ac.uk/index.htm) krill workshop in May 2021 (workshop report [here](https://www.iced.ac.uk/products.htm)), I am currently working on a conceptional model for krill recruitment. Stay tuned for more information! 

**SOLACE (since 2020)**
I joined the [SOLACE](https://solace2020.net/) (Southern Ocean Large Area Carbon Export) voyage December 2020 - January 2021 as [JETZON](https://jetzon.org/) project. Currently, I am working as a research assistant to analyse the collected samples. My research focuses on the role of zooplankton and micronekton in the carbon transport through the oceans twilight zone and I aim to quantify the seasonal lipid pump, jelly falls, and amphipod-mediated carbon export in the region. In addition, I collaborate with the CSIRO team on quantifying the mesopelagic migrant pump during the SOLACE voyage sampling period.

**SOOS leadership (since 2020)**
Since November 2020, I have been part of the leadership team of the Regional Working Group for the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean ([SOOS](https://www.soos.aq/activities/rwg/sois)) as [APECS](https://www.apecs.is/) representative. We aim for a coordination and implementation of the ocean observing system in the region and cumulating efforts in field work planning up to data management. At the moment, I am working on reviewing the spatial and temporal coverage of ocean observations in the region - Stay tuned for updates!

In December 2021, I joined the leadership team of the [Observing System Design Group](https://www.soos.aq/activities/cwg/osd). We aim to review observing system design methodologies in the Southern Ocean, develop OSD community guidelines, and connect the ocean observing community. Sign up for SOOS [here](https://airtable.com/shrB23cytbgPosZEZ) to stay up to date.  

## Previous projects
**PhD project: Role of zooplankton in the Biological Carbon Pump of the subantarctic Southern Ocean (2017-2021)**
This project explored how zooplankton impact carbon export and sequestration in the subantarctic Southern Ocean. 

I worked on:
- How zooplankton contribute in shaping the characteristic carbon export regimes in the Southern Ocean. Read about it [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.567917/full).
- Deep-sea zooplankton data at the Southern Ocean Time Series site at 47&deg;S south of Australia, collected in long-term sediment traps. Check out my [ECOmagazine article](http://digital.ecomagazine.com/publication/frame.php?i=674747&p=64&pn=&ver=html5). 
- The impact of zooplankton carcasses on subantarctic carbon flux, as carcasses have been traditionally overlooked when calculating the oceanic carbon budget. Find the published study [here](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.11971). 
- Finding ways on measuring in-situ respiration of zooplankton to test global estimates and models of plankton respiration. More information will be published soon. 

**MEASO (2018-2021)**
I contributed to the first [Marine Ecosystem Assessment of the Southern Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Ecosystem_Assessment_for_the_Southern_Ocean#:~:text=The%20Marine%20Ecosystem%20Assessment%20for,and%20Ecosystem%20Dynamics%20(ICED).), which started with the MEASO conference in 2018. Have a look at the publications that I was involved in the [MEASO Special Issue](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/10606/marine-ecosystem-assessment-for-the-southern-ocean-meeting-the-challenge-for-conserving-earth-ecosys#overview) in Frontiers of Marine Science.
