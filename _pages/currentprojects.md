## Current projects
**JETZON (since 2021)**
I am part of the [JETZON](https://jetzon.org/) ECR group. Together with the other ECRs, I aim to communicate the ecological, economic, and social importance of the oceanâ€™s twilight zone. I am also responsible for organising the JETZON call (Australian time slot) to showcase current research of the mesopelagic zone.

**ICED krill modelling (since 2021)** 
Following the [ICED](https://www.iced.ac.uk/index.htm) krill workshop in May 2021 (find the workshop report [here](https://www.iced.ac.uk/products.htm)), I am currently contributing to setting up a krill recruitment model for the Southern Ocean. Stay tuned for more information. 

**SOLACE (since 2020)**
I joined the [SOLACE](https://solace2020.net/) (Southern Ocean Large Area Carbon Export) voyage December 2020 - January 2021 to the subpolar and polar Southern Ocean under the umbrella of [JETZON](https://jetzon.org/). Currently, I am working as a research assistant to analyse the collected samples. My research focuses on the role of zooplankton and micronekton in the carbon transport through the oceans twilight zone and I aim to quantify the seasonal lipid pump, jelly falls, and amphipod-mediated carbon export in the region. In addition, I collaborate with the CSIRO team on quantifying the mesopelagic migrant pump during the SOLACE voyage sampling period.

**SOOS (since 2020)**
Since November 2020, I have been part of the leadership team of the Regional Working Group for the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean ([SOOS](https://www.soos.aq/activities/rwg/sois)) as [APECS](https://www.apecs.is/) representative. We aim for a coordination and implementation of the ocean observing system in the region and cumulating efforts in field work planning up to data management. I am currently working on reviewing the spatial and temporal coverage of ocean observations in the region - Stay tuned for updates!

In December 2021, I joined the leadership team of the [Observing System Design Group](https://www.soos.aq/activities/cwg/osd). We aim to review observing system design methodologies in the Southern Ocean, develop OSD community guidelines, and connect the ocean observing community. Sign up for SOOS [here](https://airtable.com/shrB23cytbgPosZEZ) to stay up to date.  

## Previous projects
**PhD project: Role of zooplankton in the Biological Carbon Pump of the subantarctic Southern Ocean (2017-2021)**
This project explored how zooplankton impact carbon export and sequestration in the subantarctic Southern Ocean. 

In particular, I worked on:
- How zooplankton contributes in shaping the characteristic carbon export regimes in the Southern Ocean. You can read this literature review [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.567917/full).
- Zooplankton swimmer data at the Southern Ocean Time Series site at 47&deg;S south of Australia. This data is collected with long-term sediment traps from the deep ocean, which enables a connection of carbon flux with deep-sea species composition. Check out my [ECOmagazine article](http://digital.ecomagazine.com/publication/frame.php?i=674747&p=64&pn=&ver=html5). 
- The impact of zooplankton carcasses on the subantarctic carbon flux at certain times of the year, as carcasses have been traditionally overlooked when calculating the oceanic carbon budget. Find the published study [here](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.11971). 
- Finding ways on measuring in-situ respiration of zooplankton to test global estimates and models of plankton respiration. More information will be published soon. 

**MEASO (2018-2021)**
I collaborated internationally to establish up a first [Marine Ecosystem Assessment of the Southern Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Ecosystem_Assessment_for_the_Southern_Ocean#:~:text=The%20Marine%20Ecosystem%20Assessment%20for,and%20Ecosystem%20Dynamics%20(ICED).), which started with the MEASO conference in 2018. In addition to contributing to the amphipod pages of the Southern Ocean Knowledge and Information (SOKI) wiki as an encyclopaedic resource in 2019, I was involved in several [publications](https://svenjahalfter.github.io/publications/) that were published as part of the [MEASO Special Issue](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/10606/marine-ecosystem-assessment-for-the-southern-ocean-meeting-the-challenge-for-conserving-earth-ecosys#overview) in Frontiers of Marine Science.
