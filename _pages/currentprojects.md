## Current projects

**SOLACE (since 2020)**
I joined the [SOLACE](https://solace2020.net/) (Southern Ocean Large Area Carbon Export) voyage December 2020 - January 2021 to the subpolar and polar Southern Ocean under the umbrella of [JETZON](https://jetzon.org/). Currently, I am working as a research assistant to analyse the collected samples, focusing on the role of zooplankton and micronekton in the carbon transport through the oceans twilight zone. 

**SOOS Indian Sector RWG (since 2020)**

I am part of the leadership team of the Regional Working Group for the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean (Southern Ocean Observing System - [SOOS](https://www.soos.aq/)) as [APECS](https://www.apecs.is/) representative. We aim for a coordination and implementation of the ocean observing system in the region and cumulating efforts in field work planning up to data management. Sign up for SOOS [here](https://airtable.com/shrB23cytbgPosZEZ) to stay up to date.  


**PhD project: Role of zooplankton in the Biological Carbon Pump of the subantarctic Southern Ocean (2017-2021)**

This PhD project explored how zooplankton impact carbon export and sequestration in the subantarctic Southern Ocean. 

In particular, I worked on:
- How zooplankton contributes in shaping the characteristic carbon export regimes in the Southern Ocean. You can read this literature review [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.567917/full).
- Zooplankton swimmer data at the Southern Ocean Time Series site at 47&deg;S south of Australia. This data is collected with long-term sediment traps from the deep ocean, which enables a connection of carbon flux with deep-sea species composition. Check out my [ECOmagazine article](http://digital.ecomagazine.com/publication/frame.php?i=674747&p=64&pn=&ver=html5). 
- The impact of zooplankton carcasses on the subantarctic carbon flux at certain times of the year, as carcasses have been traditionally overlooked when calculating the oceanic carbon budget. Find the published study [here](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.11971). 
- Finding ways on measuring in-situ respiration of zooplankton to test global estimates and models of plankton respiration. 


## Previous projects

**MEASO (2018-2021)**

I collaborated internationally to establish up a first [Marine Ecosystem Assessment of the Southern Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Ecosystem_Assessment_for_the_Southern_Ocean#:~:text=The%20Marine%20Ecosystem%20Assessment%20for,and%20Ecosystem%20Dynamics%20(ICED).), which started with the MEASO conference in 2018. In addition to contributing to the amphipod pages of the Southern Ocean Knowledge and Information (SOKI) wiki as an encyclopaedic resource in 2019, I was involved in several [publications](https://svenjahalfter.github.io/publications/) that were published as part of the [MEASO Special Issue](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/10606/marine-ecosystem-assessment-for-the-southern-ocean-meeting-the-challenge-for-conserving-earth-ecosys#overview) in Frontiers of Marine Science.
