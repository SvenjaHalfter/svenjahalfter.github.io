## Current projects

**Antarctic Science Platform (ASP) and Ross-RAMP (since 2022)**
I was fortunate to go to Antarctica twice this season (2022/2023)! In the upcoming months, I'll work on the analysis of the sympagic fauna community found within the platelet ice layer McMurdo Sound in October/November 2022, funded by the [Antarctic Science Platform](https://www.antarcticscienceplatform.org.nz/). Additionally, I'll analyse zooplankton data from previous Ross Sea voyages and the most recent Tangaroa voyage (TAN2302), which I could join in January-February 2023. My research will focus on distribution and succession of the most common zooplankton and micronekton taxa, e.g. Antarctic krill, juvenile Antarctic silverfish, copepods, and salps. 

**Continuous Plankton Recorder project (since 2022)**
During the last Tangaroa voyage, I was responsible for the deployment of the Continuous Plankton recorder. I will also work with the data to understand dynamics in the surface distribution of plankton and their impact on the carbon export.

**JETZON (since 2021)**
As part of the [JETZON](https://jetzon.org/) ECR group, I work on different projects: (1) I lead the international working group to benchmark the organism-component in the Biological Carbon Pump, together with Dr. Deborah Steinberg (VIMS, USA) as mentor. (2) I work with other ECRs on articles and policy briefs to communicate the importance of the mesopelagic zone to the public. (3) I am hosting the Pacific timeslot of the JETZON call every two months, a seminar series that showcases current mesopelagic research. 

**Krill projects (since 2021)** 
I'm involved in a few krill projects. For example, following the [ICED](https://www.iced.ac.uk/index.htm) krill workshop in May 2021 (workshop report [here](https://www.iced.ac.uk/products.htm)), I am currently working on a conceptional model for krill recruitment. Also, as part of the [SCAR Krill Expert Group](https://www.scar.org/science/skeg/about/), I'm involved in a publication on krill observation methods. Watch this space for more information! 

**SOOS leadership (since 2020)**
Since November 2020, I have been part of the leadership team of the Regional Working Group for the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean ([SOOS](https://www.soos.aq/activities/rwg/sois)). We aim for a coordination and implementation of the ocean observing system in the region and cumulating efforts in field work planning up to data management. At the moment, I am working on reviewing the spatial and temporal coverage of ocean observations in the region.

## Previous projects
**SOLACE (2020-2022)**
I joined the [SOLACE](https://solace2020.net/) (Southern Ocean Large Area Carbon Export) voyage December 2020 - January 2021 as [JETZON](https://jetzon.org/) project and am still working on publishing the results. My research focused on quantifying the seasonal lipid pump, the mesopelagic migrant pump, jelly falls, and amphipod-mediated carbon export.

**PhD project: Role of zooplankton in the Biological Carbon Pump of the subantarctic Southern Ocean (2017-2021)**
This project explored how zooplankton impact carbon export and sequestration in the subantarctic Southern Ocean. 

I worked on:
- How zooplankton contribute in shaping the characteristic carbon export regimes in the Southern Ocean. Read about it [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.567917/full).
- Deep-sea zooplankton data at the Southern Ocean Time Series site at 47&deg;S south of Australia, collected in long-term sediment traps. Check out my [ECOmagazine article](http://digital.ecomagazine.com/publication/frame.php?i=674747&p=64&pn=&ver=html5). 
- The impact of zooplankton carcasses on subantarctic carbon flux, as carcasses have been traditionally overlooked when calculating the oceanic carbon budget. Find the published study [here](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lno.11971). 
- Finding ways on measuring in-situ respiration of zooplankton to test global estimates and models of plankton respiration. More information will be published soon. 

**MEASO (2018-2021)**
I contributed to the first [Marine Ecosystem Assessment of the Southern Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Ecosystem_Assessment_for_the_Southern_Ocean#:~:text=The%20Marine%20Ecosystem%20Assessment%20for,and%20Ecosystem%20Dynamics%20(ICED).), which started with the MEASO conference in 2018. Have a look at the publications that I was involved in the [MEASO Special Issue](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/10606/marine-ecosystem-assessment-for-the-southern-ocean-meeting-the-challenge-for-conserving-earth-ecosys#overview) in Frontiers of Marine Science.
