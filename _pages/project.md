## Role of mesozooplankton in the Biological Carbon Pump of the Southern Ocean
This PhD projects explores how zooplankton affect the carbon export and sequestration in the subantarctic Southern Ocean. 

In particular, I work on:
- How zooplankton contributes in shaping the characteristic carbon export regimes in the Southern Ocean, looking at two case studies, the Kerguelen Plateau and the high nutrient low chlorophyll region south of Australia. This literature review will be published soon!
- Zooplankton swimmer data at the Southern Ocean Time Series site at 47&deg;S south of Australia. This data is collected with long-term sediment traps from the deep ocean, which enables me to connect carbon flux with deep-sea species composition. 
- The impact of zooplankton carcasses on the subantarctic carbon flux at certain times of the year, as carcasses have been traditionally overlooked when calculating the oceanic carbon budget.
- The contribution of four dominant copepod species in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean to passive carbon flux. This data was collected with the Japanese RV Umitaka-maru in January/February 2020. 
- Finding ways on measuring in-situ respiration of zooplankton to test global estimates and models of plankton respiration. 

## MEASO work
I am part of the [Marine Ecosystem Assessment of the Southern Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Ecosystem_Assessment_for_the_Southern_Ocean#:~:text=The%20Marine%20Ecosystem%20Assessment%20for,and%20Ecosystem%20Dynamics%20(ICED).), which started with the MEASO conference in 2018. 

- I contributed to the amphipod pages of the Southern Ocean Knowledge and Information (SOKI) wiki as an encyclopaedic resource in 2019 to enable the development of the first MEASO.
- Together with other ECRs, I wrote and developed an opinion piece on the benefits and obstacles of ECRs in large projects such as MEASO. Find more information [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.00692/full). 
- I am involved in two other MEASO publications, which are expected to come out as part of the [MEASO Special Issue](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/10606/marine-ecosystem-assessment-for-the-southern-ocean-meeting-the-challenge-for-conserving-earth-ecosys#overview) in Frontiers of Marine Science. More information will follow soon.
