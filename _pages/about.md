I graduated with a Master of Science in Marine Biology at the [University of Rostock](https://www.uni-rostock.de/en/) in Germany and at the [University Centre in Svalbard](unis.no) in the Norway in 2017, before I moved to Australia for my PhD. I'm currently working on how zooplankton control the Biological Carbon Pump in the Southern Ocean at the [Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies](https://www.imas.utas.edu.au/) in Hobart, Tasmania. After I submit my PhD thesis in August 2021, I'll start a 1-year position as research assistant, also at IMAS, while looking for postdocs. 

My main interests are:
- Role of plankton physiology, distribution and population dynamics in carbon export
- Impact of climate change on Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems
- Ocean data collection and management
